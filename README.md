This is Spenser's back-end repository, please check [here](https://github.com/HelenLyuRey/COMP30013-2022-Spenser-Frontend) for front-end.


The MERN stack is chosen to achieve the goal of faster and easier full-stack development. It is a collection of robust and powerful technologies realised by a single language, JavaScript. It separates front-end and back-end for more convenient management, reduces server cost, and maximises performance. 
- M stands for MongoDB, a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- E means express.js. It is a back-end Node.js web application framework that handles HTTP requests and server responses and route requests to controllers within an application.
- R stands for React; it is a Javascript library to write front-end user interface components.
- N stands for Node.js, an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime environment used for back-end API services and a built-in HTTP server framework for hosting web applications.
